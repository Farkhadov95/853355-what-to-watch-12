    text: `As ever, Anderson's world is created like the most magnificent
      full-scale doll's house; his incredible locations, interiors and
      old-fashioned matte-painting backdrops sometimes give the film a
      look of a magic-lantern display or an illustrated plate from a book.
      He and the cinematographer Robert D Yeoman contrive the characteristic
      rectilinear camera movements and tableaux photographed head-on. The film
      has been compared to Hitchcock and Lubitsch`,
